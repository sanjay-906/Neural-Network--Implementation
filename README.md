Input data and Network Topology is provided by a text file
Output is a text file
Implemented Back propagation (SGD)
Activation function: tanh
Dataset: XOR operations
Almost accurate results after 'trainning' for 8000 epochs

Features yet to be implemented:
> saving the best weights and restoring them
> Interface to test the Model
> Automatic Visualization of Network Topology
> Model Deployment
